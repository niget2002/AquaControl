# AquaControl

https://github.com/niget2002/AquaControl

The software in this repo is being used in my personal Reef Tank.

For more information about my reef please visit http://reef.wallings.net

There are a few things you should now about this software.

1) It was made specifically for the hardware I have
2) It was made specifically for my personal website
3) I'm only using git to make it easier to track changes

You are free to download/try my code, but I probably won't be of any help if you run into troubles.

The RaspberryPi image I used on my Pi2 can be found below. This image was designed to be used with
a 3.2" touchscreen boght from banggood.
